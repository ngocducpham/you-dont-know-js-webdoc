# You Don't Know JS (book series)

This is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language. The first edition of the series is now complete. Also, these first-edition books are now **out of print** and can no longer be purchased. They can only be read for free online here in this markdown format.

## Publishing

The content of these books was released here, and the books were also edited, produced, and published through O'Reilly (2014-2015).

## Online Video Training

I also have some JS training material available in on-demand video format.

## Contributions

These first-edition books are complete and published and will not be changed in any way, so there's no further need for contributions. They will remain here for posterity, but are not being maintained.

## License & Copyright

The materials herein are all &copy; 2013-2019 Kyle Simpson.
